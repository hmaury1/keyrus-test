## Getting Started

1. Make sure you've installed recent versions of Node.js in your machine. To test your machine versions, execute node -v and npm -v.

2. Run npm install -g grunt-cli. This command will install the latest version  of Grunt’s command line interface (CLI) globally.

3. Navigate to the project’s root directory.

4. Run npm install. This command will install all the project dependencies (as mentioned, it will create the “node_modules” folder) listed in the “package.json” file.

5. Run Grunt with grunt. Hopefully, this task will be executed correctly and you won’t encounter any errors. If errors do occur, make sure that steps 1 and 2 have been completed successfully.

6. Open your browser and type http://localhost:3000.
